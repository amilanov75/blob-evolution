# Blob Evolution Game

A browser-based evolution game where you guide and train a blob through different biomes, helping it evolve and develop new traits.

## Features

- Multiple biomes (Desert, Water, Mountains, Forest)
- Evolution system with unique traits
- Food gathering and training mechanics
- Inventory system
- Dynamic evolution based on environment
- Pet taming and training system
- Building mechanics
- Character progression

## How to Play

1. Open `blob-evolution/standalone.html` in a web browser
2. Use WASD or arrow keys to move

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys/WASD**: Move your character
- **G**: Toggle collection mode (automatically collect items in range)
- **B**: Toggle build mode (build structures)
- **N**: While in build mode, cycle through building types
- **N**: When a blob is tamed as a pet, name your pet
- **I**: Toggle inventory view
- **Click** on inventory items to select them for use
- **R**: Restart game if your blob dies

### Biomes and Their Effects

Each biome affects your blob differently:
- **Forest**: Balanced temperature, food includes berries and nuts
- **Desert**: Very hot, reduces energy faster, food includes cactus
- **Water**: Cools blob, reduces movement speed unless blob has fins, food includes fish
- **Mountains**: Very cold, reduces movement speed unless blob has fur, food includes minerals

### Stats and Survival

Your blob's stats are interconnected and critical for survival:

- **Hunger**: Decreases over time (6% per second). When below 45%, energy drains faster. Below 25%, health starts decreasing. Keep fed by collecting food.

- **Energy**: Decreases while moving (3.8 per second) and more slowly when stationary (2.2% per second when hungry). When energy falls below 20%, health starts decreasing. Completely depleted energy causes rapid health loss.

- **Temperature**: Affected by biomes. Extreme temperatures (below 8째C or above 32째C) drain energy faster. Very extreme temperatures (below 3째C or above 37째C) cause health damage.

- **Health**: Reaches zero when your blob dies. Naturally regenerates only under excellent conditions (high hunger, energy, and comfortable temperature).

### Evolution System

Your blob evolves based on:
- Experience gained from eating food
- Time spent in specific biomes
- Types of food consumed

Each evolution level grants new traits and abilities:
- **Level 1 (Tamed Blob)**: Adaptation to dominant biome
- **Level 2 (Friendly Blob)**: Adaptation based on diet preference
- **Level 3 (Loyal Blob)**: Special abilities, significantly faster movement
- **Level 4 (Companion Blob)**: Enhanced speed and environmental mastery
- **Level 5 (Guardian Blob)**: Advanced abilities and maximum speed

## Development

The game is built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
