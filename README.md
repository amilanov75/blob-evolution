# Blob Evolution

**Blob Evolution** is a browser-based game built over a long May Bank Holiday weekend — part of a friendly family coding challenge.

- 💻 Created using Cursor (AI-enhanced code editor)
- 👾 Game concept and mechanics by a 7-year-old with a bit of help from Dad
- 🎬 Video by an 11-year-old
- 🌐 Now live on GitHub Pages:  
  👉 [Play Blob Evolution](https://amilanov75.github.io/blob-evolution/)

What started as a playful idea quickly turned into a fully functional evolution sim. Just a few years ago, this would have been science fiction. Now? It’s a weekend project.
